This is a VBA macro I wrote to address an issue with how enrollment reports displayed one course that had multiple cross-listings.  In order for one department to know how many students were enrolled in different courses, one would have to find all the cross-listed sections and then manually add them together.  This macro would automate that process across hundreds of cross-listed courses among all disciplines and campuses.
